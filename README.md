The project consists of creating a google homepage clone. Difficulty wise it should not be too difficult. I will probably want to use a font for the google logo for higher definition, which might cause some peoblems with the colors. Otherwise, it shouldn't be too difficult.

List of things that need to be done:
1. Google logo (+ coloring)
2. Search bar, takes in input, redirects back to homepage.
3. Google Search and I'm feeliing Lucky
4. Header bar: Profile, Gmail, Images, Dots
5. Footer: Location + Settings
6. General style of the website. 

This should go relatively well, let us see!
