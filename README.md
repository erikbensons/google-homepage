The project consists of creating a google homepage clone. Difficulty wise it should not be too difficult. I will probably want to use a font for the google logo for higher definition, which might cause some peoblems with the colors. Otherwise, it shouldn't be too difficult.

List of things that need to be done:
1. Google logo (+ coloring)
2. Search bar, takes in input, redirects back to homepage.
3. Google Search and I'm feeliing Lucky
4. Header bar: Profile, Gmail, Images, Dots
5. Footer: Location + Settings
6. General style of the website. 

This should go relatively well, let us see!

This is Erik a couple of days later and I am finally done with it! It did end up working quite fine, just had some problems with centering objects, I think I was treating objects as block elements when they were in fact inline elements. The CSS tricks website really helped here! I think I've learned to style things pretty well overall and it doesn't look too far off from the original so I'm quite happy with it. Now I think it's time to do the second step of the project which is the results page.

By the way, I've been having some issues where the commits don't show up on github even though it says in the terminal that there are no changes that need to be committed. Hopefully I find a solution to this soon.
